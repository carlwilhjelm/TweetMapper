BayesByWordDictCreator.py takes tweets from sortedBayesPredictionsListFile
which is made by TweetBayesModel.py which takes them from ambiguousTokenizedTweetsDictFile
instead of pairwiseRankSetAmbiguousTweetsListFile and therefore makes BayesByWordDictRankSet.py necessary
this could be deprecated in later versions and made more efficient but the model would then rely on PairwiseTweetRank.py
DO NOT FORGET the reverse() logic is in the BayesByWordDictRankSet.py code
